# packages/ui (Shared UI)

Goal

- Reusable UI components for wallet, staking, DAO, and game widgets.

Components (initial)

- WalletConnectButton
- StakeWidget (approve + deposit + feedback)
- DaoProposalList (placeholder for future)
- DaoCreateProposalForm (placeholder)

TDD Plan

- Storybook stories for all components
- Snapshot tests stay stable
- Accessibility: components have roles/labels and pass axe checks
- State contracts via props; no blockchain logic here

Scripts

- npm run storybook
- npm run test
- npm run lint
- npm run build

Acceptance Criteria

- Components render with mock props and match stories
- Zero a11y violations in stories
