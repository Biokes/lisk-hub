•	Multiple players (2-8 per table)
•	Off-chain card dealing and game state management
•	Backend verifies hand rankings and pot distribution
Win Conditions:
•	Last player remaining (all others fold)
•	Best hand at showdown
Backend Settlement:
•	Backend manages all game logic
•	Calculates pot distribution
•	Determines winner(s) and prize split
•	Calls GameSettlement.settleWinner() for each payout
•	On-chain transaction creates immutable record
Player Experience:
•	Deposit tokens for Poker game
•	Join poker table (matchmaking or create table)
•	Receive hole cards via secure backend transmission
•	Play rounds with other players
•	Backend calculates and settles winnings on-chain
•	Winner receives payout confirmed by blockchain
Security Considerations:

•	Player communications encrypted (WebSockets + TLS)
•	Backend implements timeout mechanisms to prevent stuck games
•	Player balances locked until settlement complete
________________________________________
7. Fee Structure & Economics
7.1 Fee Model
Deposit Fee:
•	Amount: 2% of deposit amount
•	Timing: Deducted immediately at deposit time
•	Recipient: DAOTreasury.sol
•	Example: Player deposits 100 tokens → 2 tokens to DAO, 98 tokens in game pot
No Other Fees:
•	No withdrawal fees
•	No transaction fees (handled by Lisk L2 cost)
•	No payout fees
7.2 Token Economics
Initial Token Distribution:
•	Development phase: Minted for testing
•	Production phase: Minted for mainnet launch
•	Future: Mint rate determined by DAO governance
Supply Cap: Configurable (recommend 100M tokens initially)
Token Uses:
•	Staking in games
•	Future: DAO governance
•	Future: NFT minting
•	Future: Liquidity incentives

6. Games Specification
6.1 Game 1: Ping-Pong (Off-Chain)
Game Type: Off-chain multiplayer
Settlement: Backend-verified
Core Mechanics:
•	Two players compete in a virtual Ping-Pong match
•	Best of 3 or single match (configurable)
•	Real-time gameplay via WebSockets
•	Backend tracks score and determines winner
Win Conditions:
•	First to X points wins (e.g., 21 points)
•	In tournament format: First to win 2 matches
Backend Settlement:
•	Backend records final score
•	Calls GameSettlement.settleWinner() with winner address
•	Winnings distributed automatically
Player Experience:
•	Deposit tokens for Ping-Pong game
•	Find opponent (matchmaking or direct challenge)
•	Play game in real-time UI
•	View results and receive payout within seconds
6.2 Game 2: Poker (On-Chain Settlement, Off-Chain Logic)
Game Type: Off-chain logic, on-chain settlement
Settlement: Backend-verified with on-chain payouts
Core Mechanics:
•	Texas Hold'em poker format
•	Multiple players (2-8 per table)
•	Off-chain card dealing and game state management
•	Backend verifies hand rankings and pot distribution
Win Conditions:
•	Last player remaining (all others fold)
•	Best hand at showdown
Backend Settlement:
•	Backend manages all game logic
•	Calculates pot distribution
•	Determines winner(s) and prize split
•	Calls GameSettlement.settleWinner() for each payout
•	On-chain transaction creates immutable record
Player Experience:
•	Deposit tokens for Poker game
•	Join poker table (matchmaking or create table)
•	Receive hole cards via secure backend transmission
•	Play rounds with other players
•	Backend calculates and settles winnings on-chain
•	Winner receives payout confirmed by blockchain
Security Considerations:
•	Card dealing must be non-deterministic and verified
•	Player communications encrypted (WebSockets + TLS)
•	Backend implements timeout mechanisms to prevent stuck games
•	Player balances locked until settlement complete

7. Fee Structure & Economics
7.1 Fee Model
Deposit Fee:
•	Amount: 2% of deposit amount
•	Timing: Deducted immediately at deposit time
•	Recipient: DAOTreasury.sol
•	Example: Player deposits 100 tokens → 2 tokens to DAO, 98 tokens in game pot
No Other Fees:
•	No withdrawal fees
•	No transaction fees (handled by Lisk L2 cost)
•	No payout fees
7.2 Token Economics
Initial Token Distribution:
•	Development phase: Minted for testing
•	Production phase: Minted for mainnet launch
•	Future: Mint rate determined by DAO governance
Supply Cap: Configurable (recommend 100M tokens initially)
Token Uses:
•	Staking in games
•	Future: DAO governance
•	Future: NFT minting
•	Future: Liquidity incentives

9. Deployment & Operations
9.1 Deployment Process
Phase 1: Development (Testnet)
1.	Deploy contracts to Lisk testnet
2.	Deploy ERC20 token
3.	Mint test tokens
4.	Setup DAO Treasury
5.	Deploy frontend to testnet
6.	Beta testing with internal users
Phase 2: Production (Mainnet)
1.	Security audit of smart contracts
2.	Deploy contracts to Lisk mainnet
3.	Deploy ERC20 token to mainnet
4.	Mint initial production supply
5.	Setup DAO Treasury mainnet
6.	Deploy frontend to production

•	GameVault only accepts calls from authorized sources
•	Settlement contract callable only by admin
Token Security:
•	Standard ERC20 with overflow protection (Solidity 0.8.x)
•	No infinite minting
•	Controlled supply
Fund Safety:
•	Separate vault contract for fund management
•	No direct fund transfers without settlement verification
•	DAO treasury as separate contract
10.2 Backend Security

•	Backend verifies game outcomes before settlement
•	Anti-cheat mechanisms implemented
•	Player action logging and auditing
Communication Security:
•	HTTPS/TLS for all API calls
•	WebSocket secure (WSS) for game state updates

Data Security:
•	Database encryption at rest
•	Regular backups
•	Access controls on sensitive data
10.3 Future Audits
