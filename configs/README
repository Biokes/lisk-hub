# configs (Tooling)

Goal

- Shared configuration for linting, formatting, TS base config, and commit conventions.

Includes

- .eslintrc.json: Base eslint (TS + React), import/order rules
- .prettierrc: Formatting rules
- commitlint.config.js: Conventional commits
- tsconfig.base.json: Path aliases and TS strict mode

TDD/Validation

- Lint task ensures no unused vars/imports and consistent style
- Prettier check as part of CI
- Type-check: each workspace extends tsconfig.base.json and builds cleanly

Usage

- Extend these configs in apps and packages
- CI already runs lint/build via main.yaml
